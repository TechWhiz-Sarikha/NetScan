    "summary": "**Executive Summary**\n\nThe vulnerability scan conducted on IP address 172.67.205.101 has identified potential security concerns associated with the service running on port 2052, which is labeled as \"clearvisn?\". Due to the lack of specific vulnerability details and severity scoring, this finding requires further manual investigation to assess its impact accurately. The scan results indicate a need for immediate attention to ensure the security of the affected system.\n\n1. **Critical Findings and Their Impact**\n   - The scan has identified a potential vulnerability related to the service \"clearvisn?\" running on port 2052. Although the severity is currently unknown, the presence of an unrecognized or undocumented service could pose significant security risks, including unauthorized access, data breaches, or service disruption if exploited.\n\n2. **List of Vulnerabilities by Severity Level**\n   - **Critical:** None identified\n   - **High:** None identified\n   - **Medium:** None identified\n   - **Low:** None identified\n   - **Unknown Severity:** \n     - Potential security considerations for clearvisn? (Further investigation required)\n\n3. **Affected Systems, Ports, or Services**\n   - **System:** IP address 172.67.205.101\n   - **Port:** 2052\n   - **Service:** clearvisn? (requires verification and investigation)\n\n4. **Recommended Remediation Steps in Priority Order**\n   - **Conduct Manual Investigation:** Immediately perform a detailed manual analysis of the service running on port 2052 to identify its purpose, origin, and any associated vulnerabilities. This includes reviewing system documentation and consulting with the service provider or vendor if applicable.\n   - **Research Known Vulnerabilities:** Utilize the provided link to research any known vulnerabilities related to \"clearvisn?\" by searching for relevant security advisories, CVEs, or exploit databases.\n   - **Implement Security Controls:** If the service is deemed necessary, ensure it is securely configured, and apply any available patches or updates. If it is unnecessary or poses a risk, consider disabling or removing the service.\n   - **Monitor Network Traffic:** Continuously monitor network traffic to and from port 2052 for any suspicious activity or unauthorized access attempts.\n   - **Review Access Controls:** Ensure that access controls and firewall rules are appropriately configured to restrict access to the service based on the principle of least privilege.\n\nBy following these steps, the organization can better understand and mitigate potential risks associated with the identified vulnerability on the target system."
