    "summary": "**Executive Summary:**\n\n1. **Critical Findings and Impact:**\n   - The vulnerability scan did not detect any specific vulnerabilities on the target system (8.8.8.8). However, the absence of identified vulnerabilities does not guarantee complete security. Continuous monitoring and regular security assessments are crucial to maintain a secure environment.\n\n2. **List of Vulnerabilities by Severity Level:**\n   - Critical: None identified\n   - High: None identified\n   - Medium: None identified\n   - Low: None identified\n\n3. **Affected Systems, Ports, or Services:**\n   - Target System: 8.8.8.8\n   - Ports/Services:\n     1. Port 22 (SSH) - OpenSSH 8.2p1\n     2. Port 80 (HTTP) - Apache httpd 2.4.41\n     3. Port 443 (HTTPS) - nginx 1.18.0\n\n4. **Recommended Remediation Steps in Priority Order:**\n   1. **Patch Management:** Regularly update and patch the operating system, applications, and services to address any potential vulnerabilities that may arise in the future.\n   2. **Network Security:** Implement firewall rules to restrict access to unnecessary ports and services, reducing the attack surface.\n   3. **Secure Configuration:** Ensure secure configurations for SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS services to mitigate common attack vectors.\n   4. **Monitoring and Logging:** Set up monitoring and logging mechanisms to detect and respond to any suspicious activities on the system.\n   5. **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits and vulnerability assessments to proactively identify and address any security gaps.\n\nIt is important to note that while no vulnerabilities were identified in this scan, proactive security measures and best practices should still be implemented to enhance the overall security posture of the system."
