    "summary": "### Executive Summary\n\n#### 1. Critical Findings and Impact\nThe vulnerability scan did not identify any specific vulnerabilities on the target system (8.8.8.8). However, the absence of identified vulnerabilities does not guarantee security, emphasizing the need for continuous monitoring and regular security measures.\n\n#### 2. List of Vulnerabilities by Severity Level\n- **Critical:** No critical vulnerabilities identified\n- **High:** No high vulnerabilities identified\n- **Medium:** No medium vulnerabilities identified\n- **Low:** No low vulnerabilities identified\n\n#### 3. Affected Systems, Ports, or Services\n- **Target System:** 8.8.8.8\n- **Ports/Services:**\n  1. Port 22 (SSH) - OpenSSH 8.2p1\n  2. Port 80 (HTTP) - Apache httpd 2.4.41\n  3. Port 443 (HTTPS) - nginx 1.18.0\n\n#### 4. Recommended Remediation Steps in Priority Order\n1. **Patch Management:** Regularly update and patch the operating system, applications, and services to address potential vulnerabilities.\n2. **Network Security:** Implement firewall rules to restrict access to unnecessary ports and services, reducing the attack surface.\n3. **Secure Configuration:** Ensure secure configurations for SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS services to mitigate common attack vectors.\n4. **Monitoring and Logging:** Set up monitoring and logging mechanisms to detect and respond to suspicious activities.\n5. **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits and vulnerability assessments to proactively identify and address security gaps.\n\nCybersecurity is an ongoing process, and proactive measures are essential to safeguard systems and data."
